There are 2 games in this.

To run the first one: run the executable at the following filepath (relative to this text document): `Original Project/build/play.exe`
To run the second one: run the executable at the following filepath (relative to this text document): `Second Project/Build/grapefruit.exe`

You can also try to build the original project by going to Original Project/source/, opening command prompt in that folder and running the following command:

`py run.py [anything]`

This will attempt to create a build folder, run Cmake and build the project using an available C++ compiler. The actual dependencies are a C++ compiler (I believe MinGW should work but I switched to Clang a while ago), python 3.

This build will fail because the current code doesn't work, I made some additions and refactored things which led to the code no longer compiling. I don't remember why this happened but there is a buildable version included at `Original Project/source/buildable_version/`
