# Final Major Project 2024.

There are 2 games in this, neither finished.

# Usage

To run the first one: run the executable at the following filepath (relative to this text document): `Original Project/build/play.exe`
To run the second one: run the executable at the following filepath (relative to this text document): `Second Project/Build/grapefruit.exe`

# Build from source

You can also try to build the original project by going to Original Project/source/, opening command prompt in that folder and running the following command:

`py run.py [anything]`

This will attempt to create a build folder, run Cmake and build the project using an available C++ compiler.

## Dependencies

python 3
Cmake
C++ compiler (tested with Clang and MingW32)

This build will fail because the current code doesn't work, I made some additions and refactored things which led to the code no longer compiling. I don't remember why this happened as I started the second project at that time, however there is a buildable version included at `Original Project/source/buildable_version/`
